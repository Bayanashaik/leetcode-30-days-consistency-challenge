# Day 01 Notes

## Problem 1: Score of a String
- **LeetCode Link:** [Score of a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/score-of-a-string/description/)
- **Problem Description:**  
  Given a string `s`, calculate the "score" of the string.  
  The score is the sum of the absolute differences between ASCII values of adjacent characters.  
  Example: For `s = "hello"` â†’ Score = 13
- **Approach / Algorithm:** Iterate through string, sum absolute differences of adjacent ASCII values.
- **Key Learning:** Using `ord()` to get ASCII values, handling negative differences, iterating over adjacent elements.

## Problem 2: Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations
- **LeetCode Link:** [Final Value of Variable](https://leetcode.com/problems/final-value-of-variable-after-performing-operations/description/)
- **Problem Description:**  
  Starting with X = 0, perform operations in the array and return the final value of X.
- **Approach / Algorithm:** Iterate through operations, increment or decrement X according to the operation.
- **Key Learning:** String comparison, simple counting logic, loop through array of strings.

## Problem 3: Defanging an IP Address
- **LeetCode Link:** [Defanging an IP Address](https://leetcode.com/problems/defanging-an-ip-address/description/)
- **Problem Description:**  
  Replace every "." in an IPv4 address with "[.]".
- **Approach / Algorithm:** Iterate through the string, replace "." with "[.]" and build new string.
- **Key Learning:** String manipulation, concatenation, basic iteration.

## Problem 4: Jewels and Stones
- **LeetCode Link:** [Jewels and Stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/description/)
- **Problem Description:**  
  Count the number of stones that are also jewels.
- **Approach / Algorithm:** Iterate through stones, count if the stone exists in jewels.
- **Key Learning:** Membership check in strings, simple counting, iteration.
