Day 02 Notes
Problem 5: Two Sum
- LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/
- Problem Description: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
- Approach / Algorithm: Use two nested loops to check every pair of numbers and return indices when their sum matches target.
- Key Learning: Understand brute-force approach before optimizing with hash maps.

Problem 6: Palindrome Number
- LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/
- Problem Description: Determine whether an integer is a palindrome.
- Approach / Algorithm: Convert the number to a string, reverse it, and compare with the original string.
- Key Learning: String reversal logic and palindrome checking.

Problem 7: Roman to Integer
- LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/description/
- Problem Description: Convert a Roman numeral to an integer.
- Approach / Algorithm: Map Roman numerals to integers, handle subtraction cases using a dictionary.
- Key Learning: Use dictionary mapping and conditional subtraction logic.

Problem 8: Valid Parentheses
- LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/
- Problem Description: Determine if a string of parentheses is valid.
- Approach / Algorithm: Use a stack to check if every opening bracket has a matching closing one.
- Key Learning: Stack-based validation for parentheses matching.
