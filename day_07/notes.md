# Day 07 Notes

## Problem 25: Apple Redistribution into Boxes
- Given apples and box capacities, we must minimize the number of boxes used.
- Sort capacities in descending order and fill greedily.
- Key Idea: Use largest capacity boxes first.

## Problem 26: Maximum Number of Operations with the Same Score I
- Each operation takes two elements with the same sum as the first pair.
- Continue as long as pairs match the same sum.
- Stops when mismatch occurs.

## Problem 27: Split the Array
- Check if array can be split into 2 equal groups without any number appearing more than twice.
- Use a dictionary to count frequencies.

## Problem 28: Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value I
- Count elements less than threshold `k`.
- Straightforward loop through array.
