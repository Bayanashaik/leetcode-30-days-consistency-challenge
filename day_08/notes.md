# Day 08 Notes

## Problem 29: Minimum Absolute Difference
- Sort the array.
- Track the smallest difference between adjacent numbers.
- Store pairs that match the minimum difference.
- Efficient because sorting ensures nearest numbers are adjacent.

## Problem 30: Unique Number of Occurrences
- Count frequencies using a dictionary.
- Convert frequency values into a set.
- If duplicates exist, lengths will mismatch.
- Return True if all counts are unique.

## Problem 31: Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits
- Convert each number to string.
- Check if length of digits is even.
- Count and return how many satisfy the condition.

## Problem 32: Rank Transform of an Array
- Use set + sort to get unique sorted values.
- Map each unique value to its rank.
- Replace each element in original array with its rank.
