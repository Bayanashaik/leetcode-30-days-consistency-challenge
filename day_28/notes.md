# Day 28 Notes

## Problem 109: Maximum Number of Words You Can Type
ðŸ”— [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-words-you-can-type/)  
- **Approach**: Split sentence into words, check if any letter of a word is in broken letters, skip that word.  
- **Key Point**: Simple string traversal.  
- **Complexity**: O(n * m) (n = words, m = word length).

## Problem 110: Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
ðŸ”— [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/)  
- **Approach**: Linear scan, collect all indices of target, return first and last.  
- **Key Point**: Simple method (O(n)), can also be solved with binary search (O(log n)).  
- **Complexity**: O(n).

---

## Problem 111: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II
ðŸ”— [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/)  
- **Approach**: Count frequency of each number. Keep at most 2 of each element. Write back results into array.  
- **Key Point**: Array is sorted, so duplicates appear together.  
- **Complexity**: O(n).

---

## Problem 112: Longest Consecutive Sequence
ðŸ”— [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)  
- **Approach**: Remove duplicates, sort, then check consecutive numbers. Keep track of longest streak.  
- **Key Point**: Simple sorted array solution (O(n log n)). Optimal O(n) exists using hash sets.  
- **Complexity**: O(n log n).
